Deep Dish Deviants
Game: Slice of Sourcery
Sprint 3 Changelog

Changes:
- Overhauled how the game checks player/station interaction
	- instead of looping through every station, checking if player can and/or is trying to interact with them
	- now finds closest station to the player and checks for interactions with just that one
- Change conditions for using magic
	- previously magic was used on what the player was holding, now player uses magic on items that are on counters
- added bounds so player cannot leave the kitchen
- expanded on the pause menu to show controls and allow player to quit the game

Bug Fixes from previous sprint:
- fixed bug where if player took to long or did not give the right pizza, they would earn negative money
- fixed bug where player could interact with multiple stations at the same time
